;;; Code:

(require 'jea-string-util)

(defun jea-tweet--max-length()
	"The max size per social media post.
In the future maybe make it configurable per social media platform.
TODO converrt to defvar"
	280)

(defun jea-tweet--one-of-length()
	"How much space do we need to say length('ðŸ§µXX/XX') is 6 to mark the continuation."
	7)

(defun jea-tweet--split(sentence)
	"Return parts if the SENTENCE is splittable.
Otherwise, just return the sentence as is.  Right now urls only thing
unsplittable."
	(cond ((string-match "http" (downcase sentence))
				 (seq-filter (lambda (s) (> (length s) 0)) (jea-find-string-all sentence "\\(.*\\)\\(http[^ ]+\\)\\(.*\\)")))

;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; 1) break up into sentences

(defun jea-tweet--split-into-sentences(in-str)
	"IN-STR is the arg.  This part is very naive.
It just breaks sentences by period.  It messes up on urls though.
more thought need to go in for this problem."
	(jea-find-string-all in-str "\\([^.]+\\.\\)"))

;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; 2) remove exta spaces to save room

(defun jea-tweet--remove-extra-whitespace(in-str)
	"Remove newlines and extra (two or more) spaces.
\IN-STR is the arg to be cleaned up.  We remove newlines first.
then the inner places where there are more than one space back to
back.  Then we finally trim the leading and trailing spaces."

	(jea-string-trim
	 (replace-regexp-in-string "[ \t]\\{2,\\}" " "
														 (replace-regexp-in-string "[\n]+" "" in-str))))

;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; 3) go through the sentences and merge into paragraphs

(defun jea-tweet--merge-sentences-into-paragraphs(sentences)
	"SENTENCES hold all the lines of the text seperated."
	(let* ((max-size (- (jea-tweet--max-length) (jea-tweet--one-of-length)))

					(setq para (concat para sentence " "))
				(progn
					(setq result (cons para result))
					(setq para (concat sentence " ")))))
		(if (> (length para) 0)
				(setq result (cons para result)))
		(reverse result)))

;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; 4) decorate with the 1/x for total count

(defun jea-tweet--decorate-paragraphs(paragraphs)
	"PARAGRAPHS hold all the sentences."
	(let ((numerator 1)
				(denominator (length paragraphs))
				results '())
		(dolist (p paragraphs)
			(setq results (cons (concat (format "%sðŸ§µ%d/%d" p numerator denominator)) results))

				 (step3 (jea-tweet--merge-sentences-into-paragraphs step2))
