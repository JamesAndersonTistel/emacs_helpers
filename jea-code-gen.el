;;; Commentary:

;;; Generate boiler plate code (class, switch etc) for various
;;; languages.  When each language is turned on, it will set the
;;; defvars here.  This way we can have shortcuts pointed here that
;;; don't need to change.

;;; Code:

;;; Classes
(defvar jea-code-gen-make-class-func
	'(lambda (name functions) (message "not implemented yet."))
	"Function to generate a class.")

(defun jea-code-gen-class (name functions)
	"Generate a class named NAME with the functions in the string FUNCTIONS.

FUNCTIONS will look like \"bark, jump, skip.\""
	(funcall jea-code-gen-make-class-func name functions))

;;; functions
(defvar jea-code-gen-make-func-func
	'(lambda (name functions) (message "not implemented yet."))
	"Function to generate a function.")

(defun jea-code-gen-func (name args)
	"Generate a function named NAME with the ARGS.

FUNCTIONS will look like \"bark, jump, skip.\""
	(funcall jea-code-gen-make-func-func name args))

;;; switches
(defvar jea-code-gen-make-switch-func
	'(lambda (val cases) (message "not implemented yet."))
	"Function to generate a function.")

(defun jea-code-gen-switch (val cases)
	"Generate a switch statement.
VAL as value and CASES to compare against.

VAL will look like \"x\" and CASES like \"1, 2, 3.\""
	(funcall jea-code-gen-make-switch-func val cases))


(defun jea-code-gen-prompt (arg command)
	"ARG is prefix argument.  COMMAND is the code gen command.
For example: class,dog,sleep,bark,dig,swim.  Will insert a class
called Dog with the functions: sleep, bark, dig, swim."
