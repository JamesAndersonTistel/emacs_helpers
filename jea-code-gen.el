;;; Commentary:

;;; Generate boiler plate code (class, switch etc) for various
;;; languages.  When each language is turned on, it will set the
;;; defvars here.  This way we can have shortcuts pointed here that
;;; don't need to change.

;;; Code:

;;; Classes
(defvar jea-code-gen-make-class-func
	'(lambda (name functions) (message "not implemented yet."))
	"Function to generate a class.")

;;; Functions
(defvar jea-code-gen-make-func-func
	'(lambda (name functions) (message "not implemented yet."))
	"Function to generate a function.")

;;; Switches
(defvar jea-code-gen-make-switch-func
	'(lambda (val cases) (message "not implemented yet."))
	"Function to generate a function.")

;;; shared code between all code gens
(defun jea-code-gen-ctor-args-variable(expanded-var format-func firstp lastp)
	"This is a warrper for formatting one variable for a class constructor.
Take in a EXPANDED-VAR like: (sleep string) and pass it to the
FORMAT-FUNC to be formatted for the language in question.  For typescript it
will look like: sleep: string.  The FIRSTP signals if it is the first argument.
The LASTP is there to signal if it is the last argument so you can ommit the
trailing comma."
	(funcall format-func (car expanded-var) (car (cdr expanded-var)) firstp lastp))

(defun jea-code-gen-ctor-args-variables(expanded-vars format-func)
	"Produce code that is suitable for a class constructor.
Use EXPANDED-VARS to get the vlaues.  We need to behave differently on the
last one.  The FORMAT-FUNC has the code formatting for whatever language."
	(let ((count 0)
				(max (1- (length expanded-vars)))
				(result ""))
		(dolist (v expanded-vars)
			(setq result (concat result (jea-code-gen-ctor-args-variable v format-func
																																	 (= count 0)
																																	 (= count max))))
			(setq count (1+ count)))
		result))

;;; interactive prompt
(defun jea-code-gen-prompt (arg command)
	"ARG is prefix argument.  COMMAND is the code gen command.
For example: class,dog,sleep,bark,dig,swim.  Will insert a class
called Dog with the functions: sleep, bark, dig, swim."

;; start by bringing TS in line with py
;; do the react one. the args are the useState
;; think about a generic system: start, multi len (1 or many) middle, and end.
;; I think that pattern will be pretty universal. then new snippipts are just three
;; functions
