;;; Commentary:

;;; Generate boiler plate code (class, switch etc) for various
;;; languages.  When each language is turned on, it will set the
;;; defvars here.  This way we can have shortcuts pointed here that
;;; don't need to change.

;;; Code:

(defvar jea-code-gen-make-class-func
	'(lambda (name functions) (message "not implemented yet."))
	"Function to generate a class.")

(defun jea-code-gen-class (name functions)
	"Generate a class named NAME with the functions in the string FUNCTIONS.

FUNCTIONS will look like \"bark, jump, skip.\""
	(funcall jea-code-gen-make-class-func name functions))

(defun jea-code-gen-prompt (arg command)
	"ARG is prefix argument.  COMMAND is the code gen command.
For example: class,dog,sleep,bark,dig,swim.  Will insert a class
called Dog with the functions: sleep, bark, dig, swim.
"
	(interactive "p\nsWhat code to gen: ")
	(let* ((split (string-split command ","))
				 (command (car split))
				 (rest (cdr split)))
		(cond
		 ((equal "class" command)
			(jea-code-gen-class (car rest) (cdr rest)))
