# emacs_helpers
a disorganiszed set of elisp code that I find useful. I have not been putting much into github for the simple fact that I have been working professionally and not had the time.

## jea-password-generate

## install

add this to your `.emacs` file:

```
(load (expand-file-name "~/install_dir/emacs_helpers/jea-string-util.el"))
(load (expand-file-name "~/install_dir/emacs_helpers/jea-password-generate.el"))
(load (expand-file-name "~/install_dir/emacs_helpers/jea-code-gen.el"))
(load (expand-file-name "~/install_dir/emacs_helpers/jea-code-gen-python.el"))
(load (expand-file-name "~/install_dir/emacs_helpers/jea-tweet-assist.el"))
