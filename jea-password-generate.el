;;; code to generate passwords.  makes it easy to use org mode as a password manager

;;; Code:

(defun jea-make-pwrd--shuffle(in-str)
	"Shuffle whole sequence to make sure chars are not always first etc.
Assumes random has been seeded.

\IN-STR is the whole sequence."
	(let ((result (copy-sequence in-str))

			(setf (seq-elt result i) (elt in-str (random len))))
		result))

(defun jea-make-pwrd-generate()
	"Produce a random string that is appropriate for a password.

TODO: in the future maybe take into account a passed in arg for size"
		(let ((mycharset "abcdefghijklmnopqrstyvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTYVWXYZ")
					(mynumset "1234567890")
					(mypunctset "!@#$")
