													 "The quick fox jumped quickly."))
				(t2 (jea-test-text '(lambda ()
															(jea-string-rtrim "The quick fox jumped quickly.  	  	"))
													 "The quick fox jumped quickly."))
				(t3 (jea-test-text '(lambda ()
															(jea-string-trim "	  	  	The quick fox jumped quickly.  	  	"))
